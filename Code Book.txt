This code book explains :
a) all the data-sets in the problem
b) the existing as well as the new variables created in the database

All the data-sets in the problem are explained in README.TXT FILE.  Replicating the essential elements here :

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'test/subject_test.txt' :  Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 


Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.


NEW VARIABLES INTRODUCED :

TABLES :
actlabel     : Activity Labels table to map activity code
featurelabel : Mapping feature names for each variable
subject_train : Subject code for all training records; later merged with label train
activity_train : Records of all features for all activities; later renamed cols to feature names
label_train :    Records of all acitivy codes; later mapped with activities

subject_test : Subject code for all testing records; later merged with label test
activity_test : Records of all features for all activities; later renamed cols to feature names
label_test :    Records of all acitivy codes; later mapped with activities

activity_total : merged set of all subects, all activities
relevant_table : subsetting subject, activity, and mean / std cols from the activity_total

temp1       :  added column subject and activity into single index code
temp2       :  grouped temp1 by index code
final_output : get means of all activities by subject and activity code

VECTORS :
relevant_cols : vector of columns that have grep output of mean and std (note that this is differnt from 
"Contains" output for mean and std deviation)

index : pasted together index of subject and activity type.  Later split back into subject and activity

STEPS FOR SETTING UP THE SYSTEM :

1. Download data files from the link provided in the problem statement to UCI HAR Dataset

2. Start R Studio

3. Set working directory as the UCI HAR Dataset directory

4. Run the R script attached

5. The final_output gets stored in the same directory as the "final_output.txt" file

PLEASE NOTE : The use of grep function picks a smaller set of "mean" related variables than the "contains" 
function.  Depending upon the correct interpretation, one could use one or the other construct here.






EXISTING VARIABLES :


Prefix t : Time domain signals
tAcc-XYZ  : Accelerometer 3-axial raw signal;  captured at 50 Hz;  
tGyro-XYZ : Gyroscope 3-axial raw signal captureed at 50 Hz
The acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals
(tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) 
Body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived to otain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
Suffix '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'

New variables introduced by the code :

Subject : This column specifies the subject under consideration
Activity_code : Describes the specific activity carried out by the subject
Means of all columns grouped by the subject and activity code.
