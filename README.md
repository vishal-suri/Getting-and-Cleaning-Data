# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
# Tidying up data from Wearable sensors
# The script merges data from Training and Test Sets
# It does so by first uploading each of the datasets.  Combining subject and activity related description with each of the data sets
# It then combines the training and test data set
# It then groups data by subject and activity type
# It presents the final output by means of all parameters (of mean and std deviation) by subject and activity type
